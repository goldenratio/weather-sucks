Our Earth needs yet another Weather App.
Demo: https://doesweathersuck.com/


Proof of Concept app, to showcase:
- no transpilers needed to write modern javascript
- Making use of `.mjs` - new javascript file extension
- I don't recommend such approach for production. Use static type checkers like TypeScript. 
If you are phobic to them, get your head out of your ass.
